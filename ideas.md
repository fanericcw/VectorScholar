# Prompt

I am a fourth year undergraduate student studying statistics and computer science. I'm looking to build a data-science related project for my portfolio. Here are some of the technologies I'm interested in learning and using:
- Apache Airflow
- SQL (Snowflake, BigQuery)
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Pytorch)
- Time Series Analytics and Databases
- NoSQL solutions (Cassandra, Neo4j)
- Apache Spark
- AWS (redshift, athena, glue, msk)
- Data visualization tools (D3.js, Plotly, Matplotlib, Looker, Teableau)
- ETL pipelines
- Apache Hadoop
- Dataiku
- Huggingface
- RAG systems
- dbt
Keeping these in mind can you suggest some project ideas using a few (1-3) of these core technologies. Go 10 at a time, along with a short description of an interesting use case for it and how it would work, as well as the technologies one would use to build it.
